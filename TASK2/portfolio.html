            <img src="project1.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Project 1">
            <p>In this project machine learning algorithms can play an important role in ensuring security and authorization based on
biotechnology, anomalous detection to improve the usability and security of IoT systems. On the other
hand, attackers often view learning algorithms to exploit the vulnerabilities in smart IoT-based systems.
Motivated from these, in this paper, we propose the security of the IoT devices by detecting spam using
machine learning. To achieve this objective, Spam Detection in IoT using Machine Learning
framework is proposed. In this framework, five machine learning models are evaluated using various
metrics with a large collection of inputs features sets. Each model computes a spam score by
considering the refined input features. This score depicts the trustworthiness of IoT device under
various parameters. REFIT Smart Home dataset is used for the validation of proposed technique. The
results obtained proves the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the other existing

            <img src="project2.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Project 2">
            <p>Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which 
	moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of 
pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only 
ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the 
player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay. During the game over screen, 
the player is awarded a bronze medal if they reached ten or more points, a silver medal from twenty 
points, a gold medal from thirty points, and a platinum medal from forty points</p>
